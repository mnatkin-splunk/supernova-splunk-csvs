Use these as lookup tables in Splunk for simple IOC matching. Note: if you want to use these with ES, you need to use the versions in the EnterpriseSecurity directory. See blog post here for guidance: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/smoothing-the-bumps-of-onboarding-threat-indicators-into-splunk-enterprise-security.html

If you wish to add more IOCs to this repo, please send a PR!
